# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice, implemented in **Python**, with a focus on **clarity, fundamentals, and problem-solving discipline** rather than shortcuts.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build strong DSA foundations
- Write clean, readable code
- Develop consistency for long-term growth and open-source readiness

## 📌 What’s Inside

### Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- (More coming…)

### Algorithms
- Searching
- Sorting
- Recursion basics
- Complexity analysis
- (Expanding gradually)

---

## 🧠 Approach

- Each concept is implemented **from scratch**
- Emphasis on **understanding over memorization**
- Problems are solved without relying on advanced libraries
- Code is written as if explaining to a future contributor (or my future self)

## 📚 References

- *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* — Goodrich et al.
- LeetCode (selected problems)
- Notes from personal study sessions

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Plan

- Add structured folders for each data structure
- Include explanations and edge cases
- Gradually increase difficulty
- Prepare for real-world problem solving and open-source contribution
